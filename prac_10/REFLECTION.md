# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I got the estimates roughly right for the small exercises, but I was way off with the big programs.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I improved throughout the subject.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I was underestimating how long it would take me to complete the long exercises. Looking back at the estimates
made me realise that early on and I started allocating buffer time for the longer exercises.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I need to pay more attention to the fine details such as docstrings and comments to ensure good readability of my code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

There were slight nuances as to how another student approaches a problem and these helped me improve my own coding
practices. By reviewing moderate code, I've learned what not to do whereas on the other hand, looking at well-written
and efficient code has helped me see what works well. By learning from both good and bad examples, I have been able to
refine my own approach, leading to more readable code.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

### Explanation

I tried to ask leading questions to subtly guide the person towards the right answer while still
leaving room for them to reflect.

### Good Code Review 2

[LimDongXian](https://github.com/LimDongXian/cp1404practicals/pull/3#pullrequestreview-2425683607)

### Explanation

I tried to asked leading questions again and proposed solutions instead of imposing them. I complimented the person as
well since the code was good overall.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I don't have any complaints. On the other hand, I appreciated the detailed instructions provided during the first weeks
of learning version control as well as the repetition of key concepts. It helped me grasp the content and solidify my
understanding.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was fairly consistent throughout the subject and learned to manage my time efficiently.
